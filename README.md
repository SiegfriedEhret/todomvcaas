# TODOMVCAAS

Todo MVC As A Service.

## Why

Because you can choose a frontend framework by making a Todo MVC app like you can choose a backend one by doing a blog engine.
 
## How

- [WEB COMPONENT FOR THE WIN](http://webcomponents.org)
- It uses [fetch](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch)
 
## Install and run

Execute `bower install` to retrieve the dependencies, then run a server and open `demo.html`.
(I have an alias: `http-serve` which runs `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).

Yup.
